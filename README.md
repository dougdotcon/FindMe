SocialImpactFinder is a social impact platform designed to amplify the reach of missing persons cases. By utilizing an automated distribution system across Facebook and Twitter, it leverages a network of volunteer accounts to maximize the visibility and engagement of critical information, thereby increasing the chances of reunification.

## Purpose and Social Impact

Thousands of people go missing annually, and timely visibility is crucial for recovery efforts. SocialImpactFinder addresses this by:

*   **Democratizing Exposure:** Ensuring that missing persons cases receive widespread attention regardless of the family's socio-economic status.
